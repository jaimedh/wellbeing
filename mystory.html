    <h3>The Beginning</h3>
    <p>It wasn’t until I was grown that I realized that I wasn’t at all unique.  As a child I felt very unique but not in a good way, more like an alien. </p>

    <p>  I was born with a rare disease, I had a hole right in the middle of my abdomen.  A lot of my insides grew exposed outside my body.  When I was born, the doctors told my parents to go home, not to get attached, as I wouldn’t make it through the week.  Well they didn’t give up on me and I didn’t give up on life.  I survived surgery and made an amazing recovery.  It left me with a big scar that runs deeper then my physique. </p>

    <h3>Quake to the Core</h3>
    <p>My insides have nerve damage that range from the equivalency of a sun burn to 3rd degree burns.  As nerves are attached to everything, when my nerves misfire it effects my entire body.  I get these excruciating attacks that rock me from my core, reeking havoc on my entire Being.   Sometimes they come on so quickly that I’m left stunned. </p>

    <p>My only choice is to hold on and wait for the internal quake to stop, it could be an hour or several days.  Then it takes time to recover. </p>

    <p>As a kid my attacks were minimal.  In my twenties they were mostly manageable. In my early 30s I felt like I had it under control.  Yoga became my secret to life!  I had a strong practice.  I became a certified yoga teacher specializing in yoga for persistent pain.  I was teaching wellness workshops combining my yoga training with my Indigenous teachings.  I had built a solid foundation and found balance.  </p>

    <p>I taught all over BC, for different Indigenous gatherings, as well as at a local yoga studio.  I felt like I had a purpose and that all my pain and suffering had not been in vain. </p>

    <h3>Crumbling Down</h3>
    <p>On a beautiful fall day my life came crumbling down.  I had an attack that was so bad I ended up in the hospital.  Because my disease is so rare they didn’t know what was wrong or how to help.  I was so sick that there are days I don’t remember.  My husband didn’t think I would make it home alive.  Again I didn’t give up on life.  I <span style="color:purple;"> survived!</span> </p>

    <p>My attack lasted for months with little change.  I couldn’t really eat; I lost a lot of weight.  My organs and body were not functioning properly.  In the beginning weeks I practiced every healing modality I knew.  I prayed, seen Elders and energy healers.  I went to every doctor that would see me.  My internal quake was relentless and my entire Being was tired.  Nothing was working.  With all my might I couldn’t stop it.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion, Just Hold On</h3>
    <p>My husband would tell me in my hardest moments all I had to do was breathe.  So easy to say, but not so easy to do.</p>

    <p>What I have come to realize is that my specifics are my own but I am not unique at all.  Everyone has their story; we all have scars. Everyone has Life Challenges that quake and rock them to their core. It can creep up slowly or quickly knock you off-balance.  It sometimes lasts an hour or seems to go on forever.  When it is happening all we can do is hold on and breathe!  We can’t quake forever.</p>
