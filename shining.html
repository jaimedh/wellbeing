    <h2>The Sun is Always Shining</h2>
    <h3>Life's Teachings</h3>
    <p>I have daily practices that have had a tremendous impact on the quality of my life.  They are my understandings of what I have learned from yoga school and Indigenous teaching that have been shared in my life.   I have a strong belief in Universal Energy, a living wisdom that flows through all of us, teachings from our own ancestors, ancestors of the land, and Mother Earth.</p>

    <h3>Daily Breathing Practices</h3>

    <p>The moment I wake up I use breath and awareness to do a scan of my body.  Without trying to change anything I notice what is going on in each area of my body, breathing into the different sensations, allowing my breath to be my guide.  If I am having an extra rough day I take note of the areas that are feeling easeful.
    My favorite breathing exercise comes from a yoga teaching to help balance out the energies of the body.  Old yoga text write about Nadis, which are energy channels in the body.  There are 72 thousand Nadis which move Prana (life force) to every cell.  There are 3 main channels, one been located along the front of the spine.  Starting at the tail bone, inhaling to travel up the spine and exhaling descending down the spine helps clear that channel. After breathing this way for several rounds I feel more balanced in my body as well as better connected to Universal Energy.  </p>

    <h3>Intentions</h3>

    <p>Setting a daily intention gives me a direction and a thought to come back to over and over again.  I find my intention by connecting with my heart centre and asking myself, “what is my heart felt desire in life?”.  If nothing comes to me that day I have a few I come back to, examples are ‘to align with love’, or ‘I am healthy, I am strong’. Intentions work best if you make positive, and in the present tense, like it is already happening.</p>

    <h3>Yoga</h3>
    <p>Yoga has many different branches.  It is often commercialized as doing bendy poses on a yoga mat. The word yoga can be translated meaning ‘to yoke’ or ‘union’. By combining breath with movement you can unite your mind, body and spirit. Some days I roll out my mat and do a well sequenced practice. Other days I do movement that is the essence of a good practice: guided by my breath, I move my spine is all directions, forward fold, side bends, back bends and twist. I do simple inversion of bringing my head below my heart, balancing pose of standing on one leg, then the other.  </p>

    <h3>Conclusion, The Sun Shines On</h3>

    <p>By including accessible daily practices, I can better handle and enjoy life.  I remind myself that the sun shines everyday.  Someday there are just too many clouds to see or feel it.  Greeting the day with gratitude allows me to feel connected to something greater then myself.  Mother Earth, nature and the elements provide and teach me to trust in the universe and trust in myself.  We do not walk alone.</p>
